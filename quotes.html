	    A programming environment is a <em>user interface for
	    understanding a program</em>.  Especially in an
	    environment for learning, the environment must be
	    <em>designed to explain</em>. -- <a

	  <p>
	    Many tools -- the REPL, debuggers and profilers -- arise
	    naturally as responses to questions of the form "How can
	    my programming environment explain X?".  For a debugger, X
	    = "what happened during the crash".  For a profiler, X =
	    "what's taking time during my program".  For the REPL, X
	    is more general and less specific, since a REPL can be
	    used as a general purpose way of interrogating a program
	    for explanations.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	    What other tools can be inspired by demanding new types of
	    explanations?

	    Posner was the most important person (after my dad) in my

	  <p>
	    When people respond negatively to us, we usually worry
	    that we're doing something wrong.  But maybe we should not
	    only not fear such negative responses.  Maybe sometimes we
	    should celebrate them as a sign that we're doing something
	    right.
